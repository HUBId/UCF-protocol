# UCF-protocol

Milestone 1 for the UCF protocol includes:

* Core protobuf definitions under `proto/ucf/v1`.
* Rust bindings generated by `prost` with helpers for canonical encoding and
  digesting.
* Golden determinism fixtures stored in `testvectors/` (hex-encoded protobuf
  bytes) with tests to verify round-tripping.

## Versioning notes

Schema evolution is documented in `docs/protocol_versioning.md`. The v1 schema
now includes proposal, activation, and trace evidence messages in addition to
the original milestone and runtime evidence definitions.

## Building

This crate uses `prost-build` in `build.rs` to compile the protobuf schemas at
build time. Ensure the `protoc` compiler is available on your system PATH.

```
cargo build
```

## Testing

The determinism tests load the golden fixtures, decode them, re-encode
canonically, and recompute digests using the documented domain/schema/version
values.

```
cargo test
```
